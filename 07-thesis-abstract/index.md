## Abstract

The main goal of this bachelor's thesis is to show people something new in the theatre industry. Show people that theatre is still here and they can go out and have some fun. After covid lockdown happened people forgot about spending time in theatres.

The second goal is to create space for different sorts of people. The theatre that was chosen for the thesis rents its space to other theatres and actors. I've created 3 themes for the purpose to show how can we do it.

The first is to maintain the main repertoire from the Divadlo Bez Hranic. To keep the current audience. Just redesign the visual style of it.

The second theme is to support different groups of people. The 3 groups I chose are actors in school or amateur actors. Handicapped people and foreign citizens living in the Czech Republic. The goal of this theme is to create a safe space for these categories of people. 
For students to give them space to perform and start before they graduate. To give handicapped people chance to enjoy theatre as same as people without handicaps. Lastly, give a piece of their own culture in form of plays to foreign citizens.

Last but not least is to change the stereotypical way of building in form of little scenes. Create a unique space to present the history of the company to sponsors.

Abstract
The bachelor thesis "Visual Style of a cultural institution" deals with the issue of the visual style of theatre. In the theoretical part, we can find a cross-section of graphic designers' work. What all he must master for skills and abilities. Even a non-designer should gain insight into this challenging job and look under the hood of logo creation and redesign. For my work, I chose to create a new visual style for the theatre. To better understand the theatre world and work on the topic. I had to research several theatres in Prague and outside Prague. I compared how their websites work, how they promote themselves on social media and what they offer to the public. In the practical part, there are individual chapters that deal with the font, colour, and typography of the new visual style of the theatre. Promotion on the website and social media is an integral part. I brought something new, interesting and unconventional to my work. That could attract more people to the theatre. Both from the audience and from companies and sponsors.
