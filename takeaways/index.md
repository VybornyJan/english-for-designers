# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. It's best to be You. You are unique and you don't need to make everyone happy.
2. Creating something can be really hard but there is always a light.
3. Doing work differently is not bad but you need to follow the rusles. It's best to do it the same way as everyone else. You can be creative in private.
4. Native speaker can help you with your spoken english. There is no escape to Czech language. You need to figure it out. Same as in the world.
5. Github is fun. Markdown is not my type of "coding" HTML makes more sense to me, it's harder to read.
