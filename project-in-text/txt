The redesign of the magazine cover was one of my favourite projects so far. I enjoyed different projects as well, but this one was only mine and I'm proud of it. Magazines are not only a good source of inspiration, information, fun and many more. The main reason I like magazines is you can use them as decoration as well. My first intuition was to choose the magazines with the most unorganized covers. One might say also with covers that are not aesthetically pleasing. The idea of this task was to place the magazines into categories chronologically. From low-end to high-end based on truthful information and scientific involvement.

 As my 3 magazines, I chose "Enigma" a magazine based on the topic of conspiracy theories and science facts. The second one is "21. Století". A magazine which is taken far more seriously than Enigma. Is based on science, technology, discoveries and people. The last one is "Scientific American" which has the most reliable source of information of all 3. It's based on similar topics as the previous two.

 I choose key components from the covers. These are: name, topic and characteristic pieces such as frame or layout. I've tried to keep covers as clean as possible while maintaining the look people are used to.

For Enigma, I also redesigned the logo while pushing the magazine close to the sci-fi theme. The 21. Století was redesigned to look cleaner and more organised. With Scientific American, I moved the magazine to subscription only. This move helped me to move the barcode away. Thanks to this magazine looks cleaner and more professional.

I've set myself a goal to make all magazines more presentable and pleasing to look at. While mainly keeping them in their category. After consultation with colleagues and a small survey from users. I can happily say that this project was a success.
