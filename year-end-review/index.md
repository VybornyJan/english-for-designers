## 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

- C) A lot of my classmates are really passionate about what they do. 

## 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

- Stepping outside of my comfort zone and improvising my presentations without structure.

## 6) What's one thing you learned about yourself?

## 7) What's one thing you could have done better?
- Probably prepare for classes more.

## 8) What's one thing I could have done better?

- This corresponds to the No. 8) but mostly create something enjoyable for students, especially for people with attention span of a tomato like me.

- Nothing to fear. Great and friendly teacher with friendly and positive vibe. Class can get sometimes longer but you need those information.
