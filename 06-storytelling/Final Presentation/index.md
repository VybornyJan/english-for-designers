Slide: 01
Creative thinking & Creative growth outside of the professional habitat.

Slide:02
First of all HI! My name is John and this is a presentation I created on how to be creative. As we all know people like to talk about themselves so this presentation is from my view and perspective.

Slide:03
In the beginning, let's talk about the topics I focused on.
We have Writing, the Internet, Music, Nature, Gaming and then the last topic "It's okay to hit a wall"

Slide:04/05
Let us talk about the first topic which is gaming

Slide:06
Minecraft has been important over the years. It's a game where you can create anything. This game is over 11 years old. I won't go into too much detail about the game but I use it to build and create.
Here are some builds I found on the internet. Thanks to the amount of time I spend on school and other activities I don't play much anymore. 
1st we have a Panda mind that all the blocks are roughly 1x1 meter.
2nd is an underground dwarven city.
3rd a castle and its transformed surroundings.
4th is Asian based city on pillars.

The imagination in this game doesn't have limits. Maybe only circles.

Slide:07
Here we have The Sims 4. It's a game focused on the virtual life of your created character. You make money, family and buildings. In this game is really fun to find different goals. You can build extraordinary houses, create your second life or create a romance story.
In the pictures, you can see again pictures from the internet. Lately, it has been really hard for me to focus on little things like this.
1st house has the summer house vibe.
2nd we have a mountain cabin/villa.
3rd is a house based on a real building.
4th picture is a massive castle which probably took over 5 hours to finish.
