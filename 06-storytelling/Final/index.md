Creative thinking & Creative growth outside of the professional habitat.

- ### Slide:02
First of all HI! My name is John and this is a presentation I created on how to be creative. As we all know people like to talk about themselves so this presentation is from my view and perspective.

- ### Slide:03
In the beginning, let's talk about the topics I focused on.
We have Writing, the Internet, Music, Nature, Gaming and then the last topic "It's okay to hit a wall"

- ### Slide:04/05
Let us talk about the first topic which is gaming

- ### Slide:06
Minecraft has been important over the years. It's a game where you can create anything. This game is over 11 years old. I won't go into too much detail about the game but I use it to build and create.
Here are some builds I found on the internet. Thanks to the amount of time I spend on school and other activities I don't play much anymore. 
1st we have a Panda mind that all the blocks are roughly 1x1 meter.
2nd is an underground dwarven city.
3rd a castle and its transformed surroundings.
4th is Asian based city on pillars.
The imagination in this game doesn't have limits. Maybe only circles.

- ### Slide:07
Here we have The Sims 4. It's a game focused on the virtual life of your created character. You make money, family and buildings. In this game is really fun to find different goals. You can build extraordinary houses, create your second life or create a romance story.
In the pictures, you can see again pictures from the internet. Lately, it has been really hard for me to focus on little things like this.
1st house has the summer house vibe.
2nd we have a mountain cabin/villa.
3rd is a house based on a real building.
4th picture is a massive castle which probably took over 5 hours to finish.

- ### Slide:08-09
Next in order is Nature. In the pictures, you can see the photos I took. Being in nature is really important to clear your mind and go back to your roots. The way you view nature now is basically what you can project to your work. For me, It's a key component of relaxing my mind and taking it away from the city and noise. Speaking of noise I sometimes listen to music cuz it supports my emersion in nature.

- ### Slide:10-11
Music is one of the ways I try to stay creative that I use the most. I'd probably say that I can't work without music. The melodies and sounds really help me to focus on the stuff I work on. My main thought is that I create scenarios in my head for example this.
Imagine that you are in the old manor in the library. Your goal is to write an essay. What music would you choose from these genres? For me, it's something from a classical shelf.

- ### Slide:12-13
To find your creative inspiration, your muse it's good to look everywhere. Use Pinterest, Instagram, Youtube or your friend's work if you look up to them. In the pictures, you can see work from my friend Zack. Cuz whenever I see his work or his working I feel more motivated and creative. We live in an era where everyone has almost done everything. To get inspired and merge two things and thoughts in your view is nothing to be ashamed of.

- ### Slide:14-15
To get writing is a really good way of letting your creativity and imagination free. Creating a story about something that is only in your mind is an exciting process. In this process, you get to experience different views on a different topic. Also, it doesn't have to be a story it can be also journaling. Journaling can help you to get a different view of the problems you are going through. This way of finding creativity can be connected to other ways for example music. You can write what you hear. I wrote a movie plot on 30 seconds of piano music. It is a stereotypical plot but in my head, it works.

- ### Slide:16-END
It's okay to hit a wall. I feel tired and mad at my projects cuz I lack creativity sometimes. Im trying to use any of these topics to get me in a different mindset and maybe get a different view. For you, it doesn't have to be any of them. Every human being is different so you do you. 

- So don't forget if you feel stuck and mad.
- If you feel depressed cuz your work is not moving.
- Try games that expand your creativity.
- Go on a trip in nature, see and feel things.
- Listen to music.
- Write and novel or just a journal.
- Thats all from my presentation on how to get creative or how I get creative.

Bye and thank you for attention.
