<!-- Perhaps include style tips on capitalization of headings (sentence or title case), words to avoid, or general grammar and mechanics dos and don'ts, etc. See https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/grammar-and-mechanics/-->

- Hierarchy is really impoprtatn to me.
- Be my self in all my texts. Keep a friendly and kind tone.
- Use my talking voice. Because I don`t want to sound like a robot.
